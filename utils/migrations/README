Migrations are created by the utils/migrations script. Just create your schema objects as you would like them, run the
script, and it will generate a migration file for you. You can then run the migration file to update your database.


To run from a clean slate, delete the migrations in the ./migrations directory (it has the README file), and delete
the oldSchemas directory.
